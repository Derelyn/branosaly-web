I am from small town called Nova Bana and right now I'm based in Bratislava. I am a man,
who was searching for the right carrier path a long time, but I found it.
For few years now I was dreaming of being web developer, but I choosed a wrong path
so I was stucked at university. Once I started it, I wanted to finish it. So now after
that I can finally realizing my dream of being front-end developer.
